# since initial result is multiplied by 4 and answer is 2 digits starting w/ 2, 
# answer must be 20, 24 or 28. Isn't 28 as 8 is ruled out. so it's 20 or 24.

# 5 numbers are included in winning combo, and there are 5 slots open, so 0 is used, and most likely place is within answer.

# so initial result = 5. Ok then!
